Blog :
======================================================================
Best way to learn web development is to build something !
so I started building something when I started learning web.

###Why Blog ?
======================================================================
  * Blog is the simplest project to develop 
  * No need to worry about data and flow 
  * Something that you feel you can show others
  * Writing down about yourself makes you think more about yourself
  
>the data is alwas on your mind, sometimes it feels harder to write about yourself but writing is easier than answering the same to someone (may be a interviewer)

###me and my blogs
========================================================================
  I am not a regular blogger but like to share some hacks.
  I developed a blog each time I was learning something new in web development.
  Redesigned, redeveloped and again a new blog on some new language, host or framework.
  I have learnt web development in four years of my course (B.tech CSE) and have different versions of my blog.
  Being in 3t engg college of UP (India) It felt harder to learn things get help and motivation but from html to reactjs, from python to nodejs
  and openshift, heroku to aws, google compute engine, I played around with all and current technologies on my own.

>'blog' was my "hello world" to web development

  however now i know "todo list"
  I went every time developing my own "hello app" instead of todo list.
  Last one was interesting, I was wondering about working of 'localstorage' so I developed a crud app. [check it out here](http://satyamyadav.github.io/len-den/)
  
###versioning
===========================================================================
  I was going through my old code backups and found some different static and dynamic blogs developed while learning, I was also thinking 
  of refreshing my  blog which was not updated for a year. I collected all the old versions (whatever I could found in my backups) and versioned them.
  `course: 2012-2016`
  
  `version:  vX.Y.Z:`
  
      X: don't know, just an extra degit
      Y: year of course out of four
      Z: index of blog developed in a course year
  
  `for example: v0.2.2`
      
      second version of blog developed in second year
